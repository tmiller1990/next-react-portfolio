This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).<br>

## next-react-portfolio

This portfolio page was built to give my vanity url something to do. Check it out live at [Ty.lerMiller.com](https://ty.lermiller.com)

## Boring details
My vanity site is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and deploys from this GitHub repo with Next.js. My email is hosted with the tastefully minimal service provided by [Purelymail](https://purelymail.com/).
<br>
I used [React](https://react.dev/) with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make the front end of the site.
